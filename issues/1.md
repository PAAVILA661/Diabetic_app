## Technological Architecture

The updated technological architecture for the Diabetic App is as follows:

- **n8n** integrates **Gemini** as the only external agent.
- All other components run locally:
  - **Docker** for containerization.
  - **Qdrant** for vector search.
  - **PostgreSQL** for relational database management.

This setup ensures a seamless integration of the external agent while maintaining local control over the rest of the architecture.
